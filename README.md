This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of a forest fire based on environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen level, and humidity. The model provides a real-time prediction of whether a forest is in danger or safe from fire. The app also includes the probability of the prediction.

## Features
- **Prediction of Fire Risk**: Predicts whether a forest is in danger of a fire based on input features.
- **Probability**: Displays the probability of fire risk along with the prediction.
- **Background Change**: Changes the background image based on the prediction (forest in danger or safe).
- **Interactive Form**: A user-friendly interface where users can input environmental data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used to build the machine learning model and Flask web application.
- **Flask**: A web framework used to develop the application.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library used to train the machine learning model.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for designing the frontend of the web application.
- **Pickle**: Used to save and load the trained model.
